00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:24.132
Congratulations on finishing the Visual
Perception for Self-Driving cars course.

3
00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:28.350
The concept that you have learned in
this course are a fundamental part

4
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.932
of any self-driving car software stack.

5
00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:33.760
Let us summarize what you've learned so
far.

6
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.803
During the first week of this course,

7
00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:40.460
you have learned the fundamentals
of 3D computer vision.

8
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.260
And how to perform filtering operations
using the cross-correlation and

9
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.350
convolution operators.

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.999
You also use these fundamental
operations to create

11
00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.174
a baseline obstacle avoidance software.

12
00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:56.855
During the second week of the course, you
learned how to distill useful information

13
00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:00.755
from the images through feature
detection and description.

14
00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:04.525
You then learned how to use these
features to get odometry estimates

15
00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.695
using visual odometry.

16
00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:10.695
Due to the limitations of the classical
approaches to visual perception,

17
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.484
we targeted deep neural
networks during week three.

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.790
You learned the basic building
blocks of deep neural networks and

19
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.220
how to train them.

20
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.180
You then learned about a special
type of feetforward neural network,

21
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.720
the Convolutional Neural Network.

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.800
You explored convnets for

23
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.380
2D object detection in
the fourth week of the course.

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
You learned the 2D object
detection problem formulation.

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.400
How to train a 2D object detector.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.900
And how to use 2D object
detection output to

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.750
augment the perception stack
of a self-driving car.

28
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.033
The final topic you studied in this
course was semantic segmentation.

29
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:49.060
During week five,

30
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.660
you learned how to formulate
the semantic segmentation problem.

31
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.773
How to use convnets to perform semantic
segmentation using the feature

32
00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:58.500
decoder model.

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.410
And how to use the output
of semantic segmentation

34
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.210
to perform drivable surface estimation and
lean segmentation.

35
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.590
Finally, you put all this knowledge
together to create a self-driving

36
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.900
car obstacle avoidance system
in the carless simulator.

37
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.660
The concepts introduced in this course
are a very active area of research.

38
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.200
And I encourage you to dig deeper
into these fascinating topics

39
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.100
by reading the latest papers and
following announcements within the field.

40
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.520
To get started, I've provided you with
a list of supplementary materials

41
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.532
that will expand your understanding of
the rich field of visual perception for

42
00:02:35.532 --> 00:02:36.356
self-driving cars.

43
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
In the next course, I will introduce
the final set of components in

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.360
the self-driving car stack,
motion planning.

45
00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.995
As you learned,
motion planning is a complex,

46
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:51.250
multi-skill problem with many interesting
challenges for you to explore.

47
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.615
So join me in the next step of
your journey towards mastering

48
00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.782
the tech behind self-driving cars.
